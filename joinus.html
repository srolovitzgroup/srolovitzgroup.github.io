              <h3>Types of scholarship/funding opportunities</h3>
              Each year, we recruit several PhD students and postdocs.
              We categorize applicants into three types for both PhD and postdoc positions, based on the nature of their funding.
              <ol>
              <br>
              <!-- Type-A -->
              <li><b>Type-A:</b> Completely funded by the government, with no costs incurred by our research group.
                     These candidates are always welcome, regardless of the funding status of a project.
                     These scholarship/funding opportunities are outlined below (please visit the links for more details):
                <ul>
                  <br>
                  <li><b>PhD:</b> <a href="https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/hku_presidential_phd_scholar_programme" target="_blank">HKU Presidential PhD Scholar Programme (HKU-PS Programme)</a></li>
                  <li><b>PhD:</b> <a href="https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/hong_kong_phd_fellowship_scheme" target="_blank">Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)</a></li>
                  <li><b>Postdoc:</b> <a href="https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/jrfs/" target="_blank">RGC Junior Research Fellow Scheme</a></li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <!-- Type-B -->
              <br>
              <li><b>Type-B:</b> Partially funded by the government or the University of Hong Kong, with the remainder covered by our group's own research funds. Consequently, these positions depend on the availability of funds from our group's research projects.
                <ul>
                <br>
                <li><b>PhD:</b> Type B PhD quotas are funding opportunities internally allocated to our research group by the University. Typically, each research group receives around one quota per year, usually allotted in December. These quotas typically cover 50% of the PhD scholarship, with the remaining funding provided by our group's own research funds.
                <li><b>Postdoc:</b> <a href="https://www.hkscholars.org/" target="_blank">Hong Kong Scholars Program</a> which also requires partial support from our group's own research funds.</li> 
                </ul>
              </li>
              
              <!-- Type-C -->
              <br>
              <li><b>Type-C:</b> Completely funded by our group's own research funds.
              <b>NOTE</b>: PhD students recruited through this channel are referred to as Type-C candidates. This designation does not reflect the quality of the student but rather the funding channel through which they are recruited. If we identify an exceptionally promising student, we will not wait for the announcement of Type-A scholarships but will recruit them as Type-C students, subject to the availability of funds. The same approach applies to postdocs; we are prepared to recruit exceptional candidates fully supported by our own research funds, again subject to availability.</li>
